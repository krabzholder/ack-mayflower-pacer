    <h1>Mayflower District Court for the County of Clark</h1>
    <h3>Courtroom 103 - krabzatonin</h3></center>
    <p>Here are some very brief bullet points on what is to be expected. There is also a section for some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h1>Courtroom Conduct</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>You are required to act as if you were in a courtroom setting. I do not care about honorifics, and I do not care about anything that happens outside of the courtroom (excluding ex parte comms and other shenanigans).</li>
      <li>Do not edit, delete, or otherwise modify messages. Instead, reply to the message you intend to correct with an asterisk and the intended conveyance of the message.</li>
      <li>Unless stated otherwise, attorneys not already listed in the Trello card for a case must file a notice of appearance in #filing-center.</li>
      <li>Try to keep banter and unnecessary shitposting to a minimum, preferably none at all.</li>
      <li>All case under my docket are considered to be in session unless otherwise stated.</li>
      <li>The Attorney General's Office and the Solicitor General's Office are given access to all cases under my docket to remove the headache of adding them (with how frequently they are involved). If you are appearing and you already have access by default, you still need to file a notice of appearance in #filing-center in accordance with the pinned message in that channel.</li>
      <li>By taking part in a proceeding under my category, it is assumed that you have read these rules and agreed to them. These rules and any others conveyed in a case channel are considered orders by a judicial officer. Contravention of these rules can make you liable to 1 M.S.C. ยง 1501 "Contempt of Court," with a fine of up to $7,500.00 or five (5) minutes in the county jail.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A: Look for one in the courts discord. They will have a licensed attorney role.</p>
    <p>Q: I have exceptional circumstances beyond my control and need an extension on something.</p>
    <p>A: I am very lenient on deadlines and will happily give you an extension, provided you have a valid reason.</p>
